## How was this project born?
As a teen, I discovered French rap songs with both underground and mainstream rappers and fell in love with them. So much I developed a habit: every Friday, I would look for new albums, new artists, new genres, in order to put them in a big playlist, sorted by weekly preferences. 8ruki's album could have a single that I loved at the top of it, then followed by a Femtogo warfare music single. Why not a TKKF hyperpop track after that? And then another 8ruki song... I was sorting them one by one, listening to them through short samples. That's why I thought about making an application to help me with this process.

## Key features
### Spotify integration
With the help of the Spotify API, the application will be able to extract a base playlist that Spotify/you have made, unsorted. Then help you with an algorithm to sort those songs and create a brand new sorted playlist, tuned to your vibe

### React for Front
Using React, the application provides a fast and interactive user interface. It allows users to easily browse, preview, and sort songs in real time, making the playlist creation process smooth and enjoyable. React's component-based architecture also makes it easy to maintain and extend the app with new features.

### Node.js for Back
Node.js powers the backend of the application, handling requests between the frontend and the Spotify API. It manages user authentication, playlist data processing, and implements the sorting algorithm. Node.js ensures fast and scalable server-side operations, making the app responsive and reliable.

### Sort algorithms and options
Several sorting methods are planned to help you organize your playlist according to your preferences:

- **Comparative voting:** The app shows you two songs side by side and asks, "Which one do you prefer?" This comparative voting system allows you to gradually build a ranking of your favorite tracks based on your choices.

- **Prime song selection:** You can elect a "prime" song, instantly propelling it to the top of your playlist.

- **Delete unwanted songs:** If a track really doesn't fit your vibe ("shitass song"), you can remove it from the final playlist with a single click.

Other sorting algorithms and options may be considered in the future to further personalize and improve your playlist experience.
