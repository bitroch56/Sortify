# Sortify - your best friend for weekly updates
## How was this project born?
As a teen, I discovered French rap songs and fell in love with them. I developed a habit: every Friday, I would look for new albums, new artists, new genres, in order to put them in a big playlist, sorted by weekly preferences. 8ruki's album could have a single that I loved at the top of it, then followed by a Femtogo warfare music single. Why not a TKKF hyperpop track after that? And then another 8ruki song... I was sorting them one by one, listening to them through short samples. That's why I thought about making an application to help me with this process.
